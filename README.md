## Installation
`The Project should run without having to install the pods because it is on the repository, but if it doesn't build, please run the following commands.`

Open the terminal on the project root

- If Cocoapods is not installed (Please not ruby is required for the gem installation)
```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

## Libraries

- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) - A pure Swift library for downloading and caching images. This library does all the hard work when working with images on tableviews/collectionviews, as the reuse is nearly perfect. Doing this by hand would take a tremendous amount of work and still wouldn't work out the way I wanted to.
